Each input image is converted to grayscale and blurred using Gaussian Blur to reduce noise.\n","2. Sobel edge detection computes gradients in X and Y directions, giving the edge magnitude of the image.\n","3. The gradient magnitude image is thresholded to produce a binary edge map.\n","4. External contours are extracted from this binary map to identify individual objects.\n","5. For each contour, small noise contours are filtered by area. The convex hull is used to ensure broken edges are connected.\n","6. A bounding rectangle is drawn around each object, the width, height, and center are calculated and displayed.\n","7. The result is visualized using Matplotlib, showing bounding boxes and centers for all detected objects.\n","\n","Reason for choosing Sobel over Laplacian or Canny:\n","\n","- **Sobel** provides directional gradients (X and Y), allowing control over edge detection orientation.\n","- **Laplacian** is a second-order derivative and is very sensitive to noise; it can produce fragmented or weak edges, making contour extraction less reliable.\n","- **Canny** is more sophisticated (non-maximum suppression + hysteresis thresholding), but it often detects many small inner edges or thin lines, leading to numerous irrelevant contours in complex warehouse images.\n","- Sobel offers a **good balance of simplicity, robustness, and controllable thresholding**, making it easier to extract meaningful contours for large objects like boxes and pallets.\n","\n","Bounding boxes, dimensions, and center coordinates are all computed in pixel units.\n","This approach can be extended to video feeds or tracking by iterating through frames similarly.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2szx3Lno7bFQ"}}]}
